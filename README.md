Simple and pure html/php system to keep stock management on quarantine pretty neat. 

Steps: 
1. You will need a webserver with MySQL and PHP7.2. 
2. Clone the repo in your webserver document root. 
3. Create a mysql database and run the script in res/quarantine_stock_db.sql
3. Create a env.php file using env.example.php then change its content. 
4. Run (example): http://localhost:8000/quarantine_stock
